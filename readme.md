# Choo-todo-list

If you're familiar with the inner workings of the react-redux Todo-List, this is for you! It's the same
app, but done with Choo [Nanocomponents](https://github.com/choojs/nanocomponent).

## Video follow-along

In the following video, I will build the components out from scratch. It is quite a breath of fresh
air in contrast to the way "it was originally presented". I hope you agree!
